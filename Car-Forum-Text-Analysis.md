# Car Forum Text Analysis

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and documentation for a comprehensive text analysis of user comments on car forums. The analysis primarily focuses on co-mentions of brands, lift analysis to identify competing brands within the discussions, and the use of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) plots for visualizing brand relationships.

## Features

1. **Brand Co-mentions:**
   - Extracted and analyzed co-mentions of different car brands within the forum comments.
   - Identified patterns of brand associations and frequent co-occurrences, revealing potential brand alliances or preferences.

2. **Lift Analysis:**
   - Conducted lift analysis to measure the association strength between pairs of car brands.
   - Identified competing brands based on the lift values, highlighting brands frequently mentioned together or in contrast.

3. **MDS Plots:**
   - Applied Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to visualize the relationships between car brands in a two-dimensional space.
   - Enhanced understanding of brand proximity and relationships, aiding in the identification of market dynamics.
